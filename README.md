I have developed an analysis comparing different classification and regression models to **predict wether a song is going to be popular or not.**

### Introduction
* The data shows  general metadata around songs from Spotify's API. It shows the song's popularity and other parameters such as acousticness, danceability, energy, speechiness, valence, key, genres and subgenres...

* We want to answer the question: What characteristics of a song can determine its popularity? Which genres and subgenres predict usually the most popular songs?

* The plan is to analyze relationship between popularity and different features of the song to predict future popularity of a song with data modelling. We plan on performing Data Preparation, EDA and Modelling using models such as **linear regression**, **knn**, **logistic regression**, **SVM** and **Tree Models** and compare which one performs better and see which one predicts better if a song is going to be popular or not.
